# Naidu & Yuchtman

## Summary:
This paper asks how coercive contract enforcement shaped labor-market 
outcomes. The Master and Servant Acts criminalized workers who quit before
the end of a legally binding contract. Naidu and Yuchtman use
10,000+ prosecutions per year to show active enforcement was an active margin
of adjustment to tighten labor markets and its abolition raised wages
and made them more sensitive to demand shocks. The paper thus argues that there
are intermediate labor institutions between slavery and full employment at will.
The model is a limited-commitment model where a risk-averse worker can
insure against low spot wages by signing a fixed-wage contract with a risk 
neutral employer. Because the worker can renege the contract, employers use 
threat of prosecution. This is a risk/contract model of the type that I learned
in Law and Economics. The identification strategy is labor demand shocks - 
industry specific output price changes interacted with exogenous industry 
location.

## Questions:
---
- Judicial statistics record convictions, not threats. Is this possibly an 
underestimate?
- Distance to Lancashire or ore deposits may correlate with unobserved political
views toward prosecution, or ability to enforce and so on.
- Do counties with intense 19th centiry prosecutions display distinctive 20th 
century labor-market institutions? 

# Naidu, Nyarko, Wang
## Summary:
- The authors exploit a 2011 reform of the kalafa system that removed the 
No-Objection Certificate requirement when a migrants contract expired. They 
treat the policy as an exogenous shock to firms' monopsony power.
Combining their model with matched Ministry of Labor contracts and high 
frequency payroll data, they determine labor supply elasticities and estimate
the share of marginal product captured by workers before and after the reform.
Firms employ two inputs, incumbent migrants and new recruits. Pre-reform, each 
firm is a local monopsonist over incumbents and the recruit pool. Post-reform
firms compete Cournot for incumbents, so the wedge shrinks while the recruit 
market is unchanged. The model predicts wages and retention to rise with lower 
demand for new hires. 

## Questions:
- Explain the Cournot assumption/form?
- Is there complementary evidence that passport witholding and other threats
declined after the reform?

## Summary:
This chapter of Microeconomics covers contracts in situations other than the 
ideal case of frictionless contract execution backed by courts. How are 
promises kept when contracts are incomplete, legal enforcement is weak, or 
partners differ sharply in bargaining power? The chapter covers assurance and 
trust games, where quality/effort are unobservable, an incomplete contract model
with outside options, gift-exchange and reciprocal preferences, power indexes 
(threat pay-offs, fallback positions), and evolutionary dynamics. Efficiency 
without courts is possible but fragile. Distribution matters for efficiency 
because more equal ex-post surplus splits expand the basin of attraction of 
cooperative outcomes, extreme power skews shrink it. Social sanctions may 
dominate costly legal verification, but require dense networks. Legal 
interventions may crowd out intrinsic reciprocity. Institutional diversity is
path-dependent - socities can be locked into high-trust/high-output regimes and
so on.
## Questions:
- What data could pin down the elasticity of reciprocity with respect
to legal enforceability?
- Do these models change much with heterogeneous agents?
- Most chapter claims rely on qualitative cases. Are these models quantitatively
tested (see above...)
